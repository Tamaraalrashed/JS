            Harry Potter has no idea how famous he is. That's because he's being raised by his miserable aunt and uncle
            who are terrified Harry will learn that he's really a wizard, just as his parents were. But everything
            changes when Harry is summoned to attend an infamous school for wizards, and he begins to discover some
            clues about his illustrious birthright. From the surprising way he is greeted by a lovable giant, to the
            unique curriculum and colorful faculty at his unusual school, Harry finds himself drawn deep inside a
            mystical world he never knew existed and closer to his own noble destiny.

            War and Peace broadly focuses on Napoleon’s invasion of Russia in 1812 and follows three of the most
            well-known characters in literature: Pierre Bezukhov, the illegitimate son of a count who is fighting for
            his inheritance and yearning for spiritual fulfillment; Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, who leaves his family
            behind to fight in the war against Napoleon; and Natasha Rostov, the beautiful young daughter of a nobleman
            who intrigues both men.

            A s Napoleon’s army invades, Tolstoy brilliantly follows characters from diverse backgrounds—peasants and
            nobility, civilians and soldiers—as they struggle with the problems unique to their era, their history, and
            their culture. And as the novel progresses, these characters transcend their specificity, becoming some of
            the most moving—and human—figures in world literature.

            Crime and Punishment

            The two years before he wrote Crime and Punishment (1866) had been bad ones for Dostoyevsky. His wife and
            brother had died; the magazine he and his brother had started, Epoch, collapsed under its load of debt; and
            he was threatened with debtor's prison. With an advance that he managed to wangle for an unwritten novel, he
            fled to Wiesbaden, hoping to win enough at the roulette table to get himself out of debt. Instead, he lost
            all his money; he had to pawn his clothes and beg friends for loans to pay his hotel bill and get back to
            Russia. One of his begging letters went to a magazine editor, asking for an advance on yet another unwritten
            novel — which he described as Crime and Punishment.
